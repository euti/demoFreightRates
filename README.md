# About the app

This project was created to demo a Freight Rates Frontend prototype.

## Functionality

The App loads a Search Bar to filter some data (mocked in ./data/mockData.json for testing proposes).

Clicking on SEARCH button triggers the Data Table to show with this data filtered.

Additionally it's possible to sort normally and on reverse the data by Price, Duration or ETA clicking on the row name.

The BOOK buttons mock the possible future functionality connecting the component to a booking interface.
